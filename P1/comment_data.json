      "text": "Remaining lifetime: ???\nThat’s my answer, your best bet is to stop using it completely and dispose of the battery.\nDisposal of battery: This model is a pain for this thing. The battery is basically glued into place with a very strong adhesive. \nBottom line; don’t dismantle it, it is far too complicated and would actually probably not help.\nWhat to do: Search for local hazardous waste disposal sites near you, they often accept lithium batteries, even if they are swollen. Make sure to call the site beforehand (if possible), to inquire about disposing of a battery that is still inside a laptop, as they may have a different system for that.\nTransfer/recovery: The SSD can be removed, but it’s rather difficult to do. Your best bet is either figuring out a way to transfer via plugging into another device, or remove the SSD and go from there.\nI’m not fully sure of which ports and such your device has, but transferring to an external drive, whether HDD or SSD, is your best bet.\nTo transfer you need to plug the external drive in, using a USB to Sata adapter. Once in, get the files you are after and either copy them, or move them all to the external drive.\nAll in all, best of luck.\n\n",

      "text": "This particular laptop has the actual computer and a small battery in the screen half, and a bigger battery (and optionally a GPU) in the keyboard half. Only the battery in the keyboard half is spicy, according to OP. So the computer itself is actually still usable, and there is no need to disassemble it.\nThe problem is that iirc all the ports are on the keyboard half, so if OP doesn't want to remove the battery, they'll have to either transfer data wirelessly, or be careful to only charge the battery in the screen half, which requires separating them while doing so\n\n",

Lithium batteries is no joke, move away from the battery and get a bucket of sand in case it starts smoking, or even better, call local fire department and let professionals deal with it.\nNext time do not attempt repair if you aren't trained how to do it safely, give it to any repair shop, which not only keep your health but save you money from mistakes as this\n\n",

Have done this plenty of times with hobby batteries.\nBEFORE anyone takes this as advice, note those hobby batteries are bare cells so you can verify each cell is truly empty. Practically any consumer battery, eg phone, is managed by the device so the \"zero charge\" level it might display still has some voltage left in the cells. Likely not enough to be truly dangerous but you can't guarantee that.\n\n",

      "text": "\"The ticking sound you hear from nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries when charging could be caused by a few factors:\n\nThermal Expansion: As the batteries charge, they heat up due to the internal resistance, causing components inside the battery to expand. This expansion can result in small movements or clicks inside the battery housing.\nBattery Venting: If the battery is overcharged or charged at a high rate, internal pressure may build up, causing the safety vent or pressure release mechanism to engage. This could produce a ticking or clicking noise. This is a safety feature designed to prevent the battery from rupturing.\nCharger Relay or Switches: If the ticking is coming from the charger rather than the batteries themselves, it could be caused by the charger’s internal relays or switches engaging and disengaging as it regulates the charge current.\nChemical Reactions: During charging, chemical reactions inside the battery can create gas or pressure, which could lead to occasional noises.\n\nIf the ticking continues or the batteries get excessively hot, it may be a sign of an issue such as overcharging, poor quality cells, or a faulty charger.\"\nyour best bet is to contact the company who makes these batteries and see if that's normal.\n\n",

Phones draw unsteady current and old PCs typically only supply 500mA through USB so I was guessing it was either going below 2v for brief periods at the battery terminal or the charging circuit was seeing very fast changes in voltage, which would suggest a bad battery. Putting a big reservoir cap there just pads all that out and gives the phone the ability to draw large transient currents without the voltage dropping too much\n\n",

      "text": "Definitely not standard. Some packs may even have BMS chips and transmit digital information on that pin over something like 1wire.\nBut my phone battery just had a thermistor. Measured the resistance between ground (-) and the sense pin with a multimeter at room temperature and picked something I had on hand that was ball park close. Think it measured pretty close though. like 66.9k or something.\nThermistors are usually NTC type and very non-linear, so making the resistance high (but not in the mega ohms) will probably work fine, the charge controller will just interpret that as the battery being a bit colder\n\n",
